# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I'm a cybersecurity engineer who loves cats. I'm passionate about keeping networks and systems secure and protecting them from cyber threats.

## 🐾 About Me

When I'm not working on cybersecurity projects, I love spending time with my cats Luna and Mochi. They bring me joy and help me relax after a long day of work. I also enjoy photography and crafting, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
